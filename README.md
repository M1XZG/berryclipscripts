BerryClip Scripts
==============

These scripts were created by me to work with the BerryClip add-on experiment board for the Raspberry Pi.

BerryClip - 6 LED Board


This script provides some of the functions provided by the python scripts written by Graham.

This script requires you have wiringPI installed which will provide the 'gpio' command.

berryclip.sh = This script emulates some of the functions of the python scripts that come with the board

morseclip.sh = This script converts text to morsecode using the speaker on the berryclip
