==============

These scripts were created by me to work with the BerryClip add-on experiment board for the Raspberry Pi.

BerryClip - 6 LED Board


This script provides some of the functions provided by the python scripts written by Graham.

This script requires you have wiringPI installed which will provide the 'gpio' command.
